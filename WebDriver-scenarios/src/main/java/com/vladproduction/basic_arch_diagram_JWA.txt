Basic architecture diagram for a Java Web Application using popular technologies like Servlets, JSP, and a database:

                        |
                        v

                        |
                        v

|                 Java Web Application                  |
| (Java Servlets, JSP, Java Frameworks, Business Logic)  |
+------------------------------------------------------+
                        |
                        v
+-------------------------------------------------------+
|                     Database                           |
+-------------------------------------------------------+
```

Let's break down the components involved:

1. Web Browser: The end-user interacts with the web application using a web browser like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari. 
The browser sends HTTP requests to the web server.

2. Web Server: The web server, such as Apache Tomcat or Jetty, receives the incoming HTTP requests from the browser and 
communicates with the Java Web Application running on it.

3. Java Web Application: This is where the core logic of the web application resides. It comprises Java Servlets, 
JSP files (JavaServer Pages), and Java frameworks like Spring or Java EE as per the application design. The Java code 
handles the business logic, request processing, and generating dynamic content to be sent as HTTP responses.

4. Database: The Java Web Application might interact with a relational database management system (RDBMS) like MySQL, 
Oracle, or PostgreSQL for data storage and retrieval. The application uses JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) or an ORM 
(Object-Relational Mapping) framework like Hibernate to manage database operations.

The Java Web Application receives requests from the web server, processes them based on the defined servlets and JSPs, 
interacts with the database for data manipulation, and generates dynamic HTML content as responses. The generated HTML 
content is sent back to the web server, which then forwards it to the web browser for rendering.

Note that this is a simplified representation, and depending on the complexity of the application, there can be 
additional components, application layers, or integration with external services.
