How does Java Web Application is related to Web Drivers? Chrome for example?

Java Web Application and web drivers, such as ChromeDriver for Chrome, are related in the context of automated testing 
of web applications.

Java Web Application:
A Java Web Application is a software application that runs on a web server and is accessed by users over the internet 
through a web browser. It is built using Java technologies like Servlets, JSP (JavaServer Pages), and Java Frameworks 
like Spring or Java EE. Java Web Applications are developed to provide dynamic and interactive web content.

Web Drivers:
Web drivers, such as ChromeDriver, are automation tools that allow developers to control web browsers programmatically. 
They provide APIs to initiate and interact with web browsers like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari. Using web drivers, 
developers can automate web actions like opening URLs, filling out forms, clicking buttons, and validating web elements.

How are they related?
Web drivers are often used in the context of automated testing for Java Web Applications. They enable automation testers 
to interact with web browsers and simulate user actions, thus automating the testing process. Test frameworks like 
Selenium WebDriver, which has bindings for Java, provide APIs to control web browsers using web drivers.

For example, in a Java-based test framework like Selenium WebDriver, you can write test scripts in Java to interact 
with a web driver like ChromeDriver. These test scripts can launch the Chrome browser, navigate to specific URLs within 
your Java Web Application, perform actions like clicking buttons, entering input, and assert expected outcomes.

Overall, web drivers like ChromeDriver enhance the testing capabilities of Java Web Applications by enabling automated 
testing and facilitating the simulation of user actions and browser interactions.
